# compute cleavpairs

```
compute ID group_ID cleavpairs args
```

- args=list of the possible arguments

```
    cleavpairs args = < pair_style name> norm N <direction>
    < pair_style name > = name of the pair_style from which interactions are collected
    norm = include this keyword if you want to normalize the results in units of surface created 
    N = number N of new surfaces created to normalize the interactions (requires norm keyword)
    <direction> = possible values x, y, z. The plane perpendicular to the selected direction is used (requires norm keyword)
```

This compute collects the scaled interactions which are used to calculate the work to create a new interface. Note that it cannot be used for any pair_style, since the calculation of the scaled interactions for the cleaving must be obtained within the pair_style itself. For this reason, modified pair_styles are available in the package (see ADD).

The `norm` keyword normalize the interaction for units of interface created (i.e., the result will be in units of [Energy] / [lenght]$^2$). The keyword must be followed by:

1. a positive integer $N$ specifying the number of interfaces created, which is used to calculate the total area created to normalize the work
2.  a direction (x,y,z). The direction specify the normal to the newly created surface. If e.g., z is specified, then the new interface $S$ will be equal to  $S = x_{edge} * y_{edge}$. 

The total area $S_{TOT}$ used for the normalization will be therefore $S_{TOT}=S*N=x_{edge} * y_{edge} * N$, where $x_{edge}$ and $y_{edge}$ are the size of the box in the x and y directions.

Note: that at the moment this works only for non-triclinic box.


Note: If the keyword norm is not specified, than the compute will only report the energy taken from the specified pair_style (no normalization).
